# TigerBeetle Blog

Continuing the [tradition](https://matklad.github.io/2019/11/13/rust-analyzer-blog.html), I've been
also blogging somewhat regularly on TigerBeetle's blog, so you might want to check those articles
out or even subscribe (my favorite RSS reader is [_RSSSSR_](https://matklad.github.io/2025/06/26/rssssr.html)):

[Today's post](https://tigerbeetle.com/blog/2025-11-22-mathematics-of-consensus/) is a video version
of [_Notes on Paxos_](https://matklad.github.io/2020/11/01/notes-on-paxos.html)!
