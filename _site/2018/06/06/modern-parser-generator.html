<h1>Modern Parser Generator</h1>
<div id="preamble">
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hi! During the last couple of years, I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time writing
parsers and parser generators, and I want to write down my thoughts
about this topic. Specifically, I want to describe some properties of
a parser generator that I would enjoy using. Note that this is not an
"introduction to parsing" blog post, some prior knowledge is assumed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why do I care about this at all? The broad reason is that today a lot
of tools and even most editors use regular expressions to
approximately parse programming languages, and I find this outright
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454/1936422">b҉a͡rb̢ari͞c͘</a>. I understand
that in practice parsing is not as easy as it is in theory:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
Law: You can&#8217;t check code you can&#8217;t parse. Checking code deeply
requires understanding the code&#8217;s semantics. The most basic
requirement is that you parse it. Parsing is considered a solved
problem. Unfortunately, this view is naïve, rooted in the widely
believed myth that programming languages exist.

<p>I&#8217;ve used various parser generators, implemented one,
<a href="https://github.com/matklad/fall/">fall</a>, and still haven&#8217;t met a parser generator

<p>The post is split into three major chapters:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although this text is written in Emacs, I strongly believe that a
semantic-based, reliable, and fast support from tooling is a great
boon to learnability and productivity. A great IDE support is a must
for a modern parser generator, and this chapter talks mostly about
IDE-related features.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most important productivity boost of a parser generator is the
ability to fiddle with grammar interactively. The UI for this might
look as a three-pane view, where the grammar is on the first pane,
example code to parse is in the second pane and the resulting parse
tree is in the third one. Editing first two panes should reactively
update the last one. This is difficult to implement with most
yacc-like parser generators, I&#8217;ll talk more about it in the next
section.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second most important feature is inline tests: for complex
grammars it could be really hard to map from a particular rule
specification to actual code that is parsed by the rule. Having a test
written alongside the rule is invaluable! The test should be just a
snippet of code in the target language. The "gold" value of the parse
tree for the snippet should be saved in the file alongside the grammar
and should be updated automatically when the grammar changes. Having
inline tests allows to fit the "three pane UI" from the previous into
two panes because you can just use the test as your second pane.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here&#8217;s a video that shows how it works in fall: <a href="https://youtu.be/gb1MJnTcvds" class="bare">https://youtu.be/gb1MJnTcvds</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that even if you write your parser by hand, you still should use such
"inline tests". To do so, write them as comments with special markers, and write
a small script which extracts such comments and turns them into tests proper.
Here&#8217;s
<a href="https://github.com/matklad/libsyntax2/blob/9500ad521121f501aea02f549223eb583cb298ee/src/parser/grammar/types.rs#L145-L168">an
example</a> from one experimental hand-written parser of mine. Having such examples
of "what does this <code>if</code> parses?" greatly simplifies reading of parser&#8217;s code!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here&#8217;s the list of important misc IDE features, from super important to very
important. They are not specific to parser generators, so, if you are <strong>using</strong> a
parser generator to implement IDE support for your language, look into these
first!</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>extend selection to the enclosing syntactic structure (and not just
to a braced block). A super simple feature, but this combined with
multiple cursors is arguably more powerful than vim&#8217;s text objects,
and most definitely easier to use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fuzzy search of symbols in the current file/in the project: super
handy for navigation, both more important and easier to implement
than goto definition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Precise syntax highlighting. Highlighting is not a super-important
feature and actually works ok even with regex approximations, but
if you already have the syntax tree, then why not use it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go to definition/find references.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Errors and warnings inline, with fixes if available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extract rule refactoring, pairs well with extend selection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Code formatting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Smart typing: indenting code on <code>Enter</code>, adding/removing trailing
commas when joining/splitting lines, and in general auto magically
fixing punctuation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Code completion: although for parser generators dumb word-based
completion tends to work OK.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here&#8217;s a short demo of some of these features in fall: <a href="https://youtu.be/WRWmwfBLf7o" class="bare">https://youtu.be/WRWmwfBLf7o</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I want to emphasize that most of these features are <strong>ridiculously</strong> easy to
implement, if you have a parse tree for your language. Take, for example, "fuzzy
search of symbols in the project". This is a super awesome feature for
navigation. Basically, it is CTAGS done right: first, you parse each file (in
parallel) and build a list of symbols for it. Then, as user types, you
incrementally update the changed files. Using fall, I&#8217;ve implemented this
feature for Rust, and it took me three small files:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>*
<a href="https://github.com/matklad/fall/blob/527ab331f82b8394949041bab668742868c0c282/lang/rust/src/editor/file_symbols.rs">find_symbols.rs</a>
  to extract symbols from a single file, 21(!) lines.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>*
<a href="https://github.com/matklad/fall/blob/527ab331f82b8394949041bab668742868c0c282/indxr/src/lib.rs">indxr.rs</a>,
  a generic infra to watch files for changes and recompute the index incrementally, 155 lines.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>*
<a href="https://github.com/matklad/fall/blob/master/lang/rust/src/editor/symbol_index.rs">symbol_index.rs</a>
  glues the previous two together, and adds
  <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/fst">fst</a> by ever-awesome BurntSushi
  on top for fuzzy search, 122 lines.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is actually practical: initial indexing of rust-lang/rust repo
takes about 30 seconds using a single core and fall&#8217;s ridiculously
slow parser, and after that everything just works:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/KyUUDcnOvUw" class="bare">https://youtu.be/KyUUDcnOvUw</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A small note on how to pack all this IDE functionality: make a library. That
way, anyone could use it anywhere. For example, as a web-assembly module in the
online version. On top of the library you could implement whatever protocol you
like, Microsoft&#8217;s LSP, or some custom one. If you go the protocol-first way,
using your code outside of certain editors could be harder.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="parse-tree"><a class="anchor" href="#parse-tree"></a>Parse Tree</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Traditionally, parser generators work by allowing the user to specify
custom code for each rule, which is then copy-pasted into the
generated parser. This is typically used to construct an abstract
syntax tree, but could be used, for example, to evaluate arithmetic
expressions during parsing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I don&#8217;t think this is the right API for the parser generator for three
reasons though.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It feels like a layering violation because it allows to intermix parsing with
basically everything else. You can literally do code-generation during parsing.
It makes things like
<a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2007/11/24/the-context-sensitivity-of-cs-grammar/">the
lexer hack</a> possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It would be very hard to implement reactive rendering of the parse
tree if the result of parsing is some user-defined type.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most importantly, I don&#8217;t think that producing <strong>abstract</strong> syntax
tree as a result of parsing is the right choice. The problem with AST
is that it, by definition, looses information. The most commonly lost
things are whitespace and comments. While they are not important for a
command-line batch compiler, they are crucial for IDEs, which work
very close to the original source code. Another important IDE-specific
aspect is support for incomplete code. If a function is missing a body
and a closing parenthesis on the parameter list, it&#8217;s still better be
recognized as a function. It&#8217;s difficult to support such missing
pieces in traditional AST.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I am pretty confident that a better API for the generated parser is to
produce a parse tree which losslessly represents both the input text
and associated tree structure. Losslessness is a very important
property: it guarantees that we could implement anything in principle.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve outlined one possible design of such lossless representation in the
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2256">libsyntax2</a> RFC, the simplified
version looks like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">

<span class="tok-p">}</span><span class="tok-w"></span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That is, the result of parsing is a <strong>homogeneous</strong> tree, with nodes
having two bits of information besides the children:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Type of a node: is it a function definition, a parameter, a
comment?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Region of the source text covered by the node.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A cool thing about such representation is that <strong>every</strong> language uses
the same type of the syntax tree. In fall features like extend
selection are implemented once and work for all languages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you need it, you can do the conversion to AST in a separate
pass. Alternatively, it&#8217;s possible to layer AST on top of the
homogeneous tree, using newtype wrappers like</p>

<p>Parser generator should automatically generate such AST wrappers. However, it
shouldn&#8217;t directly infer them from the grammar: not every node kind needs an AST
wrapper, and method names are important. Better to let the user specify AST
structure separately, and check that AST and parse tree agree. As an example
from fall, here is the

<h3 id="incremental-reparsing"><a class="anchor" href="#incremental-reparsing"></a>Incremental Reparsing</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another important feature for modern parser generator is support for
incremental reparsing, which is obviously useful for IDEs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One thing that greatly helps here is the split between parser and
lexer phases.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is much simpler (and more efficient) to make lexing
incremental. When lexing, almost any change affects at most a couple
of tokens, so in theory incremental lexing could be pretty
efficient. Beware though that worst-case relexing still has to be
linear, because insertion of unclosed quote changes all the following
tokens.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In contrast, it is much easier to change tree structure significantly
with a small edit, which places upper-bound on incremental reparsing
effectiveness. Besides, making parsing incremental is more complicated
because you have to deal with trees instead of a linear structure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An interesting middle ground here is an incremental lexer combined
with a fast non-incremental parser.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="lexer"><a class="anchor" href="#lexer"></a>Lexer</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Traditional lex-style lexers struggle with special cases like ml-style
properly nested comments or Rust raw literals which are even not
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/cb8ab33ed29544973da866bdc3eff509b3c3e789/src/grammar/raw-string-literal-ambiguity.md">context-free</a>.
The problem is typically solved by injecting custom code into lexer,
which maintains some sort of state, like a nesting level of
comments. In my experience, making this work properly is very
frustrating.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These two tricks may make writing lexer simpler.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead of supporting lexer states and injecting custom code, allow to pair
regex, which defines a token, with a function which takes a string slice and
outputs <code>usize</code>. If lexer matches such external token, it then calls supplied
function to determine the other end of the token. Here&#8217;s an example from fall:
<a href="https://github.com/matklad/fall/blob/527ab331f82b8394949041bab668742868c0c282/lang/rust/syntax/src/rust.fall#L4">external
token</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/matklad/fall/blob/527ab331f82b8394949041bab668742868c0c282/lang/rust/syntax/src/rust.fall#L1294-L1324">custom
functions</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Often it is better to use layered languages instead of lexer
states. Parsing string literals is a great example of this. String
literals usually have some notion of a well-formed escape
sequence. The traditional approach to parsing string literals is to
switch to a separate lexer state after <code>"</code>, which handles
escapes. This is bad for error recovery: if there&#8217;s a typo in an
escape sequence, it should still be possible to recognize literal
correctly. So alternative approach is to parse a string literal as,
basically, "anything between two quotes", and then use a separate
lexer for escapes specifically later in the compiler pipeline.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another interesting lexing problem which arises in practice is
context-sensitivity: things like contextual keywords or <code>&gt;&gt;</code> can
represent different token types, depending on the surrounding code. To
deal with this case nicely, the parser should support token
remapping. While most of the tokens appear in the final parse tree as
is, the parser should be able to, for example, substitute two <code>&gt;</code> <code>&gt;</code>
tokens with a single <code>&gt;&gt;</code>, so that later stages of compilation need
not to handle this special case.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="parser"><a class="anchor" href="#parser"></a>Parser</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A nice trick to make parser more general and fast is not to construct
parse tree directly, but emit a stream of events like "start internal
node", "eat token", "finish internal node". That way, parsing does not
itself allocate and, for example, you can use the stream of events to
patch an existing tree, doing minimal allocations. This also divorces
the parser from a particular tree structure, so it is easier to
plug-in different tree backends.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Events also help with reshuffling the tree structure. For example,
during event processing we can turn left-leaning trees to
right-leaning ones or flatten them into lists. Another interesting
form of tree reshuffling is attachment of comments. If a comment
immediately precedes some definition, it should be a part of this
definition. This is not specified by the language, but it is the
result that human would expect. With events, we can handle only
significant tokens to the parser and deal with attaching comments and
whitespace when reconstructing tree from a flat list of events.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="miscellaneous-concerns"><a class="anchor" href="#miscellaneous-concerns"></a>Miscellaneous concerns</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To properly implement incremental reparsing, we should start with a
data structure for text which is more efficient to update than
<code>String</code>. While we do have quite a few extremely high-quality
implementations of ropes, the ecosystem is critically missing a way to
talks about them generically. That is, there&#8217;s no something like
Java&#8217;s <code>CharSequence</code> in Rust (which needs a much more involved design
in Rust to avoid unnecessary overhead).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Luckily, the parse tree needs to remember only the offsets, so we can
avoid hard-coding a particular text representation, and we don&#8217;t even
need a generic parameter for that.</p>

<p>Homogeneous trees make reactive testing of the grammar possible in
theory because you can always produce a text representation of a tree
from them. But in practice reactivity requires that "read grammar,
compile parser, run it on input" loop is fast. Literally generating
source code of the parser and then compiling it would be too slow, so
some kind of interpreted mode is required. However, this conflicts
with the need to be able to extend lexer with custom code. I don&#8217;t
know of a great solution here, but something like this would work:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>require that all lexer extensions are specified in the verbatim
block of the grammar file and don&#8217;t have external dependencies,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for IDE support, compile the lexer, and only the lexer, in a temp
dir and communicate with it via IPC.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A possible alternative is to use a different, approximate lexer for
interactive testing of the grammar. In my experience this makes such
testing almost useless because you get different results in
interesting cases and interesting cases are what is important for this
feature.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In IDEs, a surprisingly complicated problem is managing a list of open
and modified files, synchronizing them with the file system, providing
consistent file-system snapshots and making sure that things like
in-memory buffers are also possible. For parser generators, all this
complexity might be dodged by requiring that all of the grammar needs
to be specified in a single file.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So we want to write a parser generator that produces lossless parse
trees and which has an awesome IDE support. How do we actually <strong>parse</strong>
a text into a tree? Unfortunately, while there are many ways to parse
text, there&#8217;s no accepted best one. I&#8217;ll try to do a broad survey of
various options.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;d love to discuss the challenges of the textbook approach of just
using a context-free grammar/BNF notation. However, let&#8217;s start with a
simpler, "solved" case: regular expressions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Languages which could be described by regular expressions are called
regular. They are exactly the same languages which could be recognized
by finite state machines. These two definition mechanisms have nice
properties which explain the usefulness of regular languages in real
life:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Regular expressions map closely to our thinking and are easy for
humans to understand. Note that there are equivalent in power, but
much less "natural" meta-languages for describing regular
languages: raw finite state machines or regular grammars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finite state machines are easy for computers to execute. FSM is
just a program which is guaranteed to use constant amount of
memory.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Regular languages are rather inexpressive, but they work great for
lexers. On the opposite side of expressivity spectrum are Turing
machines. For them, we also have a number of meta-languages (like
Rust), which work great for humans. It&#8217;s interesting that a Turing
machine is equivalent to a finite state machine with a pair of stacks:
to get two stacks from a tape, cut the tape in half where the head
is. Moving the head then corresponds to popping from one stack and
pushing to another.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And the context-free languages, which are described by CFGs, are
exactly in between languages recognized by finite state machines and
languages recognized by Turing machines. You need a push-down
automaton, or a state machine with <strong>one</strong> stack, to recognize a
context-free language.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>CFGs are powerful enough to describe arbitrary nesting structures and
seem to be a good fit for describing programming languages. However,
there are a couple of problems with CFGs. Let&#8217;s write a grammar for
arithmetic expressions with additions, multiplications, parenthesis
and numbers. The obvious answer,</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>E -&gt; E + E | E * E | (E) | number</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>has a problem. It is under specified and does not tell if <code>1 + 2 * 3</code>
is <code>(1 + 2) * 3</code> or <code>1 + (2 * 3)</code>. We need to tweak the grammar to get
rid of this ambiguity:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>E -&gt; F | E + F
F -&gt; T | F * T
T -&gt; number | (E)</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I think the necessity of such transformations is a problem! Humans don&#8217;t think
like this: it took me three or four courses in formal grammars to really
internalize this transformation. And if we look at language references, we&#8217;ll
typically see a
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.22.1/reference/expressions/operator-expr.html#operator-precedence">precedence
table</a> instead of BNF.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another problem here is that we even can&#8217;t workaround ambiguity by
plainly forbidding it: checking if CFG is unambiguous is undecidable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So CFGs turn out to be much less practical and simple than regular
expressions. What options do we have then?</p>

<p>The first choice is to parse <strong>something</strong>, not necessary a context-free
language. A good way to do it is to write a parser by hand. A
hand-written parser is usually called a recursive descent parser, but
in reality it includes two crucial techniques in addition to just
recursive descent. The pure recursive descent works by translating
grammar rules like <code>T &#8594; A B</code> into a set of recursive functions:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="rust"><span></span><span class="tok-k">fn</span> <span class="tok-nf">parse_t</span><span class="tok-p">()</span><span class="tok-w"> </span><span class="tok-p">{</span><span class="tok-w"></span>
<span class="tok-w">    </span><span class="tok-n">parse_a</span><span class="tok-p">();</span><span class="tok-w"></span>
<span class="tok-w">    </span><span class="tok-n">parse_b</span><span class="tok-p">();</span><span class="tok-w"></span>
<span class="tok-p">}</span><span class="tok-w"></span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The theoretical problem here is that it can&#8217;t deal with
left-recursion. That is, rules like <code>Statements &#8594; Statements ';'
OneStatement</code> make recursive descent parser to loop infinitely. In
theory, this problem is solved by rewriting the grammar and
eliminating the left recursion. If you had a formal grammars class,
you probably have done this! In practice, this is a completely
non-existent problem, because we have loops:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="rust"><span></span><span class="tok-k">fn</span> <span class="tok-nf">parse_statements</span><span class="tok-p">()</span><span class="tok-w"> </span><span class="tok-p">{</span><span class="tok-w"></span>

<span class="tok-p">}</span><span class="tok-w"></span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next problem with recursive descent is that parsing expressions with
precedence requires that weird grammar rewriting.  Luckily, there&#8217;s a simpler
technique to deal with expressions. Suppose you want to parse <code>1 + 2 * 3</code>. One
way to do that would be to parse it with a <code>loop</code> as a list of atoms separated
by operators and then reconstruct a tree separately. If you fuse these two
stages together, you get a loop, which could recursively call itself and nest,

do it once :)</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most important feature of hand-written parsers is a great support
for error recovery and partial parses. It boils down to two simple
tricks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are parsing a homogeneous sequence of things (i.e, you are inside the
loop), and the current token does not look like it can begin a new element, you
just skip over it and start the next iteration of the loop. Here&#8217;s an
<a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/blob/9891f562cc0acb505ee5ff2f30626253ace0201a/compiler/psi/src/org/jetbrains/kotlin/parsing/KotlinParsing.java#L1048-L1136">example</a>

line</a>, we&#8217;ll get <code>null</code> if current token could not begin a class member
declaration.

we just skip over it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are parsing a particular thing <code>T</code>, and you expect token <code>foo</code>,
but see <code>bar</code>, then, roughly:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>if <code>bar</code> is not in the <code>FOLLOW(T)</code>, you skip over it and emit error,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if <code>bar</code> is in <code>FOLLOW(T)</code>, you emit error, but <strong>don&#8217;t</strong> skip the
token.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That way, parsing something like</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight"><code data-lang="rust"><span></span><span class="tok-k">fn</span> <span class="tok-nf">foo</span><span class="tok-p">(</span><span class="tok-w"></span>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>would correctly recognize incomplete function <code>foo</code> (again, its easier to
represent such incomplete function with homogeneous parse trees than with AST),
and a complete struct <code>S</code>. Here&#8217;s another
<a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/blob/9891f562cc0acb505ee5ff2f30626253ace0201a/compiler/psi/src/org/jetbrains/kotlin/parsing/KotlinParsing.java#L1219">example

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although hand-written parsers are good at producing high-quality error
messages as well, I don&#8217;t think that this is important. In the IDE
context, for syntax errors it is much more important and beneficial to
get a red squiggly under the error immediately after you&#8217;ve typed
invalid code. Instantaneous feedback and precise location are, in my
personal experience, enough to fix syntax errors. The error message
can be just "Syntax error", and more elaborate messages are often make
things <strong>worse</strong> because mapping from an error message to what is
actually wrong is harder than just typing and deleting stuff and
checking if it works.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is possible to simplify authoring of this style of parsers by
generating all recursive functions, loop and Pratt parsers from
declarative BNF/PEG style description. This is what Grammar Kit and
fall do.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="embracing-ambiguity"><a class="anchor" href="#embracing-ambiguity"></a>Embracing ambiguity</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another choice is to stay within CFG class but avoid dealing with
ambiguity by producing <strong>all</strong> possible parse trees for a given
input. This is typically achieved using non-determinism and
memorization, using GLR and GLL style techniques.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here I&#8217;d like to call out
<a href="https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter">tree-sitter</a> project, which actually
ticks quite a few boxes outlined in this blog post. In particular, it uses
homogeneous trees, is fully incremental and has surprisingly good support for
error recovery (though not quite as good as hand-written style parsers, at least
when I&#8217;ve last checked it).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="abandoning-generality"><a class="anchor" href="#abandoning-generality"></a>Abandoning generality</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yet another choice is to give up full generality and restrict the
parser generator to a subset of unambiguous grammars, for which we
actually could verify the absence of ambiguity. This is how traditional
parser generators like yacc, happy, menhir or LALRPOP work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The very important advantage of these parsers is that you get a strong
guarantee that the grammar works and does not have nasty
surprises. The price you have to pay, though, is that sometimes it is
necessary to tweak an already unambiguous grammar to make the stupid
tool understand that there&#8217;s no ambiguity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I also haven&#8217;t seen deterministic LR parsers with great support for
error recovery, but looks like it should be possible in theory?
Recursive descent parsers, which are more or less LL(1), recover from
errors splendidly, and LR(1) has strictly more information than an
LL(1) one.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, what is the best choice for writing a parser/parser generator?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It seems to me that the two extremes are the most promising: hand
written parser gives you utmost control over everything, which is
important when you need to parse some language, not designed by you,
which is hostile to the usual parsing techniques. On the other hand,
classical LR-style parsers give you a proof that the grammar is
unambiguous, which is very useful if you are creating your own
language. Ultimately, I think that being able to produce lossless
parse trees supporting partial parses is more important than any
particular parsing technique, so perhaps supporting both approaches
with a single API is the right choice?</p>
